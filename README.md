To use the bot, you first need to add it to your Telegram account:  

Open the Telegram app on your device.  
Search for the bot username (the one you specified when creating the bot) in the search bar.  
Once you find the bot, click on it to open a chat window.  
Click on the "Start" button to initiate a conversation with the bot.  
Once you have started a conversation with the bot, you can use it by clicking on one of the three buttons that appear in the chat window ("Stupid", "Fat", or "Dumb").    Each button corresponds to a different type of joke. When you click on a button, the bot will send you a joke based on the category you selected.  

The bot will also record the number of times each button is clicked and store this information in a PostgreSQL database. You can view the number of clicks for each user by visiting the web page you created, which displays the data in a table.
